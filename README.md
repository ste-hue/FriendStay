# FriendStay

Welcome to our apartment sharing app!

Our app allows a network of trusted friends to share their apartments with one another. Instead of traditional renting, the app uses a token system where users are automatically charged for the number of days they stay in someone else's apartment. By using blockchain technology, the token transactions can be securely and transparently recorded on a decentralized platform. The app also uses smart contract to automate the process of reservation and payment.

Here's how to use our app:

Create an account: Sign up for an account by providing your personal information and connecting your blockchain wallet.
List your apartment: Once your account is set up, you can list your apartment by providing information about the location, amenities, and availability of your space.
Search for an apartment: Use the search function to find apartments in your desired location. You can filter the results by dates, price, and amenities.
Make a reservation: Once you've found an apartment you'd like to stay in, use our token system to make a reservation. You can also communicate with the host and ask any questions you might have.
Stay and enjoy: Once your reservation is confirmed, you can stay in the apartment and enjoy your trip. You'll be charged for the number of days you stay and the host will be paid.
Leave a review: After your stay, you can leave a review of the apartment and host to help other users make informed decisions.
Please note that it is important to consider any legal and regulatory requirements for such type of sharing economy platform in the locations where the apartments are located.

We hope you enjoy using our app and happy travels!
